# Acoustic-Extinguisher-Fire
An innovative AI-based solution that classifies and helps simulate extinguishing fire through acoustic waves. This project leverages machine learning and sound classification to identify fire-prone environments such as Gasoline, Thinner, Kerosene, and LPG and predicts whether the fire can be extinguished using specific sound frequencies.
